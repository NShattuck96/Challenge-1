The challenge was to edit the given code and to clean it up and edit marks to make the site fuction better, and make the code easier to read. While showing off what we have learned throughout week 1 of class. 
The HTML of the code gives the main layout of the site, and gets the proper information out so a site visitor can get the baic idea of what Horiseon is.  The CSS added stlye to the site by aranging boxes and organzing like materials together to make the site more coherant and asteticly pleasing. 

The HTML is laid out in a way so each linel of code is read as you would see it on the page starting at the header and ending with the footer.  Each section of the code is labeled acordingly as to make it easier to return to the code and find placement should edits need to be made.  The CSS controls the colors and manages the layouts of the site. Each section of CSS is broken up into ways that corrispond with the section of the site that it is editing. For example things that control the whole site are at the top, and the Header section of code is followed up behind that.
